# seattle-flu-js-prototype

This repo contains prototypes and visualization sketches for the Web-based Seattle Flu platform.

This project uses [NWB](https://github.com/insin/nwb) boilerplate technology. I have a general aversion to Webpack and Mapbox will not run using Parcel-Bundler, so this was a good alternative. If someone else can set up a stable Webpack environment, I'm happy to move the project to it.

# How To Run

2. `npm install`
3. To run locally: `npm start`

# To Dos
