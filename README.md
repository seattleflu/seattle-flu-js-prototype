# seattle-flu-js-prototype

This repo contains prototypes and visualization sketches for the Web-based Seattle Flu platform.

This project uses [NWB](https://github.com/insin/nwb) boilerplate technology. I have a general aversion to Webpack and Mapbox will not run using Parcel-Bundler, so this was a good alternative. If someone else can set up a stable Webpack environment, I'm happy to move the project to it.

# How To Run

1. Clone repo
2. `npm install`
3. To run locally: `npm start`


# The Mapbox Token

Since this is a public repo, I am keeping the token private. I am happy to share my token (just Slack me), or we can create a MapBox token for the project that we all have.

# To Dos

- [ ] Set up the general layout
- [ ] Move the visualization from Observable to this layout
- [ ] Refine map settings
- [ ] Load all remaining maps
- [ ] Test simple interactions
